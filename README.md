## Instructions

As of right now, this repository is going to be used to post common code that we all use. If you want to contribute to the main repo, you must create a branch off the main repo into your own personal github account. From there, create changes and then create a pull request to the main branch. Then, anyone who has ownership/moderator abilities would be able to accept these pull requests and make changes to the main branch accordingly.
