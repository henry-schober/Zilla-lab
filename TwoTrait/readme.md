## This file is to help figure out how the two trait analysis works Guarav.

Theres two specific scripts, one that is denoted the first half and one
denoted second half. The reason behind this is that they are both from our
very original SSD script, just split in half as you only need to run the first
half ONCE, and use the same output files for all three traits. The second
script is the most important as it contains the renumf and blupf90 commands. I
also added the parameter file that you would want to use for the renumf. Let
me know if there are any questions
