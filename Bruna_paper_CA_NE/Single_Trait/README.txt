Project: Bruna analysis of Dairy Cows CA vs NE
Created by: Henry Schober 9/26/24

You are here: Single Trait model of CA or NE

The purpose of this directory is to streamline our analysis and clean our directories compared to those on the CDCB server.

The cows in this analysis are born after 2000, and we take only the first lactation

Workflow
  1. Make sure Pedigree files and Phenotype files were made from original phenotypes and pedigree directories.
  2. Run either Pheno_cgs.sh or cgs_pheno.sh, both work but cgs_pheno.sh is a script that includes a for loop so it makes all of the phenotypes_no_small files for both states
  3.
